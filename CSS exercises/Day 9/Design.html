                you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. There's a natural law of karma
                that vindictive people, who go out of their way to hurt others, will end up broke and alone. The fear is
                the fuel that we use for overachievement. If I wasn't afraid at times, I wouldn't work as hard.</p>
